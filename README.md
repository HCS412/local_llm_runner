# 🧠 Local LLM Alignment Pipeline

This project is an experiment in building a self-reflective AI pipeline that runs entirely on **open-source language models**, powered locally through [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai).

### 🌌 Purpose
To create an AI system that:
- Generates responses
- Critiques itself using outside-the-lines, soulful principles
- Revises its outputs
- Reflects on its own transformation

All without relying on hosted APIs or centralized alignment filters.

### 🛠️ Stack
- LM Studio + GGUF models (e.g. Mistral-7B Instruct, Phi-2)
- Python 3.10+
- No cloud required

### 🔁 Pipeline Steps
1. **Generate** → Thoughtful initial response
2. **Critique** → Use outsider ethical principles
3. **Revise** → Improve based on critique
4. **Reflect** → Analyze transformation

### 🧪 Try It
Run:
```bash
python main.py "What is freedom in a digital age?"
